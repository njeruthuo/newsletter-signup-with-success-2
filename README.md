## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Add their email and submit the form
- See a success message with their email after successfully submitting the form

  - The field is left empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- TailwindCSS
- HTML5
- JavaScript
- CSS3
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### Continued development

I would like to ask for help in developing a part of this solution. The email state is not updating in time, that is, it is one step back. Once I submit the form, the email state is not updated immediately and hence not available in the re-render. If you can help me with this, please reach out.
Thanks in advance.
